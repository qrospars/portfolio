        CYTOO company asked me and some of my schoolmates at university to create an image processing tool
        to analyse many muscular fibers images at once, and find striations within.<br><br>
        You can see an example of an image that they gave us below :

    <img class="work-hover-text-content-im" src="images/Cytoo_Stries.jpg">

        We had one full-time month to develop it, and each one of us had specific tasks to accomplish. <br>
        We used Python to develop it, even for the graphic interface.<br>
        I used LBP patterns and k-means algorithms to recognize striations inside the images,
        and it worked pretty well. We improved it using machine learning.<br>
        You can find the github link below and clone it if you want to test the software :
