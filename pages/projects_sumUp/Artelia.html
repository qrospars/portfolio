        I am currently developing a maritime traffic tool for Artelia and Total groups. They asked me to make in 3 months
        a complete tool that would analyse AIS data, turn it into a database and finally analyse it using a web-based application.
        <br>
        I used web technologies like d3.js for making charts and mapbox / leaflet for making maps

        I am really proud of the final result, even if it is still in development. Unfortunately, I can't tell you more about
        the way I made it or the final purpose of the project because it is completely confidential, but you will find some screenshots
        below :
