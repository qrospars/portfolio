                    In 2018, I developed a maritime traffic tool for Artelia and Total groups. They asked me to make in
                    3 months
                    a complete tool that would analyse AIS data, turn it into a database and finally analyse it using a
                    web-based application.

                    <br/>I used web technologies like d3.js for making charts and mapbox / leaflet for making maps

                    I had to make a web scraping of about 1300 ships on three different websites to take
                    information about these ships.
                    For that, I mainly used BeautifulSoup, a Python's library.

                    I am really proud of the final result, even if it is still in development. Unfortunately, I
                    can't tell you more about
                    the way I made it or the final purpose of the project because it is completely confidential,
                    but you will find some screenshots
                    below :
